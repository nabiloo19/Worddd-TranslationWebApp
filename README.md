is a Vue JS Web Application that does Translation Services to more than 10 languages.

It supports PWA, so as to ease the accessibility by making it an application.

Although it functions as a PWA, translation services, for the time being, are ONLINE. So make sure you are connected to the Internet to send and recieve the translation.
